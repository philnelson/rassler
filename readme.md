#What is Rassler
Rassler is a retro pro wrestling RPG. You are a brand-new pro wrestler in the territorial era. Travel from town to town trying to make a couple of bucks, keep an eye on your overall health and well-being, gain fans, live the ups and downs of the road, and lose a lot of predetermined contests.

#Download Releases

Rassler is free while in development, and [releases are available on itch.io][link]. If you want to support development, you can donate on itch or pay $3.00+ and get a cool exclusive magnet featuring one of the wrestlers from the game. Even if you don't pay, the [Rassler Community][comm] is open to you and I'd be glad to have your feedback. Rassler (the game) and Phil Nelson (me) support and admire the [Superkick Foundation][superkick].

[Release Notes are available in the devlog][dev].
